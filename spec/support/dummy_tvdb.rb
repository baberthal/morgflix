                      are merely opportunities for its highly trained
                      employees to confuse, undermine, betray and royally
                      screw each other. At the center of it all is suave
                      master spy Sterling Archer, whose less-than-masculine
                      code name is Duchess. Archer works with his
                      domineering mother Malory, who is also his boss.

                      Lana Kane and her new boyfriend, ISIS comptroller
